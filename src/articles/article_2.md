# Choosing the right color can affect your sales?

# Find out how people harness the power of colors to boost sales.

Have you ever wondered why most “for sale” signs are in red? This is because many studies have found that colors affect the way we feel, and it can trigger emotions to purchase.

We have been conditioned since young that the sky is blue, but in actual fact, the light from the sun is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. The sky is blue due to a process known as Rayleigh scattering, where blue light scatters more efficiently than longer wavelengths of visible light. Likewise, we are conditioned to believe certain colors represent certain emotions and they are associated to various feelings.

Scientists at the University of Durham research wrote in the Nature journal. “We find that wearing red is consistently associated with higher probability of winning.” Red is also associated with urgency, danger and power. It also triggers action, thus often used in “for sale” signs.

Red triggers the nervous system for people to notice and buy, blue on the other hand deals with anxiety and causes us to relax. It is effective to remove fear and widely used in the financial and medical industry. Light blue gives a sense of freedom and security, while dark blue is associated with authority, seriousness and tradition.

So the important question is, are you using the appropriate colors for your brand, for your products and marketing materials? If your target audience does not relate to your color choices, it can deter sales. For example, it is unwise to use neon colors to attract consumers above 65 years old. It is also not optimal to use gold color to target teenagers.
