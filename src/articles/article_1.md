# How to survive & thrive in 2022?

The pandemic has changed the landscape of our economy. In the past, most businesses close to celebrate the holidays but this year many have decided to open on the 1st day of the year hoping to generate more income.

It is apparent that entrepreneurs of today must make greater efforts to stay afloat.

**Create Value**

Gone are the days where one can start a business and gain customers easily by word-of-mouth marketing. In today's economy, businesses must focus on creating value to consumers.

Here are some questions to consider:

1. Why would a consumer choose to your brand rather than your competitor's?
2. What are your key selling points & how do you effectively communicate that to your target audience?
3. What are your customers' pain points & how is your business addressing those needs?

These are questions to consider before even creating your logo. Afterall, a logo is much more than an image, it is a symbol that represents your business.

Should I invest in brand design for my company?

1. My business is profitable, but its growth rate is slow.
2. I am selling a product/service that has great demand in a highly competitive environment.
3. I want my business to stay competitive and take greater market share.
4. My business is successful and is ready to scale.
5. I am a startup company with a unique or superior product than my competitors.

If your business belongs in any of these categories above, it is likely that your business requires a professional brand strategy.
